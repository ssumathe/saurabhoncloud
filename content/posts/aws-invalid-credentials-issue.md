ðŸ§© Problem Overview

While using AWS CLI, you might sometimes face the following error even when your credentials are correct:
An error occurred (AuthFailure) when calling the DescribeVolumes operation: 
AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials
Example:
aws ec2 describe-volumes --profile mycred

This error can be deceptive â€” itâ€™s not always about wrong keys or permissions.
In many cases, itâ€™s caused by a time synchronization issue between your local VM and AWS servers.

ðŸ•’ Why This Happens

AWS uses timestamp-based request signing.
If your system time is out of sync by more than a few minutes, the signature becomes invalid â€” leading to credential validation errors.

To check your systemâ€™s current time sync status, run:

timedatectl

If you notice:
Reference ID: 00000000 ()

â€¦it means no external NTP (Network Time Protocol) server is configured â€” your VM is using its own clock, which can drift over time.

ðŸ§  Quick Recap: What is NTP?

NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a protocol that synchronizes computer clocks over a network.
It ensures all systems â€” including your VM and AWS â€” agree on the same time.
Accurate time sync is critical for authentication, logging, and request signing.

ðŸ§° Resolution Steps

Check your chrony configuration file:
cat /etc/chrony.conf

Youâ€™ll typically see lines like:
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
pool 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst

âœ… Ensure the pool is reachable and valid for your environment.

Verify NTP connectivity:
chronyc sources -v

If you see stratum values like 2, 3, 4, your sync is healthy.
If all show 0, it indicates a problem with NTP connectivity.

(Recommended) Use Amazonâ€™s own NTP service
Within an AWS VPC, you can use the Amazon Time Sync Service (ATSS), accessible without internet access.

Update your /etc/chrony.conf as follows:

server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4

Once your time synchronization is fixed, AWS CLI commands should work seamlessly:

aws ec2 describe-volumes --profile mycred


No more "AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials" errors!

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

If youâ€™re managing multiple EC2 or on-prem nodes, automate this time configuration via Ansible or Terraform to ensure consistent NTP settings across your fleet.
