🧩 Problem Overview
While using AWS CLI, you might sometimes face the following error even when your credentials are correct:
An error occurred (AuthFailure) when calling the DescribeVolumes operation:
AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials
Example:

🧩 Problem Overview</p><p>While using AWS CLI, you might sometimes face the following error even when your credentials are correct:
An error occurred (AuthFailure) when calling the DescribeVolumes operation:
AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials
Example:
aws ec2 describe-volumes &ndash;profile mycred</p><p>This error can be deceptive — it’s not always about wrong keys or permissions.
In many cases, it’s caused by a time synchronization issue between your local VM and AWS servers.</p><p>🕒 Why This Happens</p><p>AWS uses timestamp-based request signing.
If your system time is out of sync by more than a few minutes, the signature becomes invalid — leading to credential validation errors.</p><p>To check your system’s current time sync status, run:</p><p>timedatectl</p><p>If you notice:
Reference ID: 00000000 ()</p><p>…it means no external NTP (Network Time Protocol) server is configured — your VM is using its own clock, which can drift over time.</p><p>🧠 Quick Recap: What is NTP?</p><p>NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a protocol that synchronizes computer clocks over a network.
It ensures all systems — including your VM and AWS — agree on the same time.
Accurate time sync is critical for authentication, logging, and request signing.</p><p>🧰 Resolution Steps</p><p>Check your chrony configuration file:
cat /etc/chrony.conf</p><p>You’ll typically see lines like:</p><h1 id=use-public-servers-from-the-poolntporg-project>Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.</h1><p>pool 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst</p><p>✅ Ensure the pool is reachable and valid for your environment.</p><p>Verify NTP connectivity:
chronyc sources -v</p><p>If you see stratum values like 2, 3, 4, your sync is healthy.
If all show 0, it indicates a problem with NTP connectivity.</p><p>(Recommended) Use Amazon’s own NTP service
Within an AWS VPC, you can use the Amazon Time Sync Service (ATSS), accessible without internet access.</p><p>Update your /etc/chrony.conf as follows:</p><p>server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4</p><p>Once your time synchronization is fixed, AWS CLI commands should work seamlessly:</p><p>aws ec2 describe-volumes &ndash;profile mycred</p><p>No more &ldquo;AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials&rdquo; errors!</p><p>💡 Pro Tip</p><p>If you’re managing multiple EC2 or on-prem nodes, automate this time configuration via Ansible or Terraform to ensure consistent NTP settings across your fleet.</p><p>Author: Saurabh — CloudOps & DevOps Engineer
