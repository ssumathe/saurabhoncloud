AWS was creating the EKS nodes with unecrypted volume type and we learned that with eksctl commands to create the eks nodes AWS by default creates unencrypted volume as they recommend clients or users to manage the encryption (which i think should be by defualt encrypted.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to fix this in our operational lower environments we had 2 options which I want to describe in this blog:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How We Optimized Our AWS Costs by 50% — Real Lessons from the Field</title><link>https://saurabhoncloud.com/posts/how-we-optimized-our-aws-costs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://saurabhoncloud.com/posts/how-we-optimized-our-aws-costs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-we-optimized-our-aws-costs-by-50--real-lessons-from-the-field"&gt;How We Optimized Our AWS Costs by 50% — Real Lessons from the Field&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will share the strategies and lessons learned during our journey to optimize AWS costs. Our team identified key areas of waste and implemented changes that ultimately led to a 50% reduction in our cloud spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="understanding-the-cost-drivers"&gt;Understanding the Cost Drivers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in our optimization process was to identify the main cost drivers in our AWS environment. We utilized AWS Cost Explorer to analyze our spending patterns and pinpoint areas where we could make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
